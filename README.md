# Bike Sharing Dataset Analysis

This time I will analyze the bike sharing dataset. And extract knowledge that can be used to make decisions. This dataset contains bike renter data and some weather attributes.
After looking at this data I can conclude 2 questions, namely:
1. How does the season affect the number of bike rentals?
2. How does the number of bike rentals by casual users and registered users compare?

To analyze the bike sharing dataset and answer the two questions, I will analyze and visualize the data. First, I will examine the correlation between the seasonal variables and the number of bike loans. Next, I will compare the number of bike loans by casual users and registered users using the corresponding graphs.
